(optional) TODO!

1. Register Validator
   I added some validators inside the register form for the users to have more secure account.
   User ID needs to be more than 6 characters long.
   User Name needs to be more than 4 characters long.
   Password needs to be more 6 characters long and have more than 1 special character.

2. Watch user inside the User Profile Page
   Inside the user Profile Page, user can watch that user by clicking watch button instead of watching them via entering the email.

3. Comments and likes list of the feed shows the href to the User Profile Page
   User can go to the other user's profile page by clicking the link inside the comments and likes list of the feed.

4. No Empty Comment
   Feed comment cannot be empty and will be validated once the user clicks the comment button.

5. User Live Update
   When the user add or remove the feed, it will be added or removed from the feeds list shown to the user without a paga reload/refresh.

6. Logout
   User can logout by simply clicking the logout button.
